# Java-LinkedList-DataStructureAssignment-

The purpose of this project is to implement a linked list data structure to store High-Scores in a game. I chose the game rock-paper-scissors. The user can choose to play Rock-Paper-Scissors against the computer as much as they want and then choose to display the High-Scores afterwards.
